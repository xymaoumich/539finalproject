            <h2>Welcome to My Travel Journal !</h2>
            <p>
                Travel has always been my favorite way of understanding the world — by walking its streets, tasting its food,
                and listening to the rhythm of each country. I’ve spent the past years exploring more than ten nations,
                capturing the beauty and the spontaneity of the road through the lens of my trusted <strong>Sony A7M3 + 24–240mm</strong>.
                This camera has seen mountain peaks, desert sunrises, ocean cliffs, and cities that never sleep.
            </p>

            <p>
                This website is where all of those journeys come together.
                I built it as a personal archive — a place to map every country I’ve visited,
                trace the exact routes I’ve traveled, and organize my photography in a way that tells a story.
                Each photo, each pin on the map, each trip line drawn is a memory frozen in time.
                I wanted a space that reflects not just where I’ve been, but how those places felt.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you explore this site, I hope you’ll see the world the way I did — not just through photos,
                but through the emotions, the curiosity, and the quiet moments that inspired them.
                Traveling changes people.
                This journal is a small piece of how it changed me.
